# iCloud Contacts Organizer

<!--start-->
Stringing together a way to use a bit of hacking and AI to get my contacts better organized.

## Getting Started

1 - Clone this repo.

2 - Create an environment with the requirements.
    
```
        > make env
```

3 - Explore - If you are more into Python, a good place to start is `jupyter lab` from the root of the project, and 
  look in the `./notebooks` directory. If GIS is more your schtick, open the project 
  `./arcgis/icloud-contacts-organizer.aprx`.
